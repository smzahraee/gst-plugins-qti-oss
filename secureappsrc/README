The demo secureappsrc is used for verifying the secure video playback in secure memory.

Now the demo only supports the special clips. In the clips, there are a four bytes header before every frame data.
If disable the macro SECURE_PLAYBACK in file secureappsrc.c, the demo will be changed to non-secure version. The
non-secure demo only support h264 decoding now.

./secureappsrc [OPTION]... [FILE]...

[OPTION]
1. h264
2. hevc
3. vp9

./secureappsrc 1 video.raw.h264
./secureappsrc 2 video.raw.hevc
./secureappsrc 3 video.raw.vp9

The demo secureappsrc2 is used for verifying the secure video playback in secure memory by supporting new input buffer
sharing mechanism. The secure input buffers are allocated in GST-OMX, which is different with the previous secureappsrc.

Now the demo only supports the special clips. In the clips, there are a four bytes header before every frame data.
If disable the macro SECURE_PLAYBACK in file secureappsrc2.c, the demo will be changed to non-secure version. The
non-secure demo only support h264 decoding now.

./secureappsrc2 [OPTION]... [FILE]...

[OPTION]
1. h264

3. vp9

./secureappsrc2 1 video.raw.h264
./secureappsrc2 2 video.raw.hevc
./secureappsrc2 3 video.raw.vp9

Some definitions in the project have been replaced by self-defined ones.
Please make sure the alignment of some definitions:
secure_handle <-> QSEECom_handle (in QSEEComAPI.h)
enum SecureCopyResult <-> enum SampleClientResult (in content_protection_copy.h)
SecureCopyDir <-> SampleClientCopyDir (in content_protection_copy.h)
